# Documentation

- I used create-react-app to quickly bootstrap most of the project
- I have used graphQL in a small project before, and I knew I wanted something relatively straightforward and with little overhead. After some research, this led me to graphql-request which seemed like an appropriate lightweight option. I also used react-query because I know it offers me a lot out of the box: caching, fetching, retries etc.
- I started out with wiring up the endpoint; this would probably take me the most time as I'm more comfortable building UIs.
